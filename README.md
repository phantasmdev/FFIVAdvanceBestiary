# FFIVAdvanceBestiary
A basic application that displays enemy data from Final Fantasy 4 Advance (Game Boy Advance).

This application shows the same data as you would see in the official cartridge of the Game Boy Advance game Final Fantasy IV Advance.
This project is personally planned for a future project that will require this data.

Instructions for use will be added later once the full app is developed.
