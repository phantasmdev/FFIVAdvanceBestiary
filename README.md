# FFIVAdvanceBestiary
A basic application that displays enemy data from Final Fantasy 4 Advance (Game Boy Advance).

This application shows the same data as you would see in the official cartridge of the Game Boy Advance game Final Fantasy IV Advance.
This project is personally planned for a future project that will require this data.

If you need to use any enemy data, just import the Bestiary.py script as a module.
I've set it up in such a way where all the objects are accessible in the class,
all you need to access is the enemy_list variable, which is set to a list and then
appends each object to the list.

The mainwindow.py script is merely for the GUI. There are still bugs to be fixed but this will be dealt with at a later date if need be.
This program is mainly here for reference during gameplay.

The full application can be downloaded here:
